# Discord-Bot
Hello!
This is a Discord Bot with the intention of logging the hours of our students. His name is "EyeSpy", and I hope he is of great use to you. 
The images you'll find below are what you should see when you have him working his shift.

  Note:
You will need the code running on your device in order for him to function, I worry that !stop function can be used by just about anyone, so there should be a way for people 
to not interact with the bot itself in order for that to happen. 
The image below are the text channel id's that you would have to replace.

Simply right clicking on a text channel should bring up a menu, and you should be able to grab the Channel ID by selecting "Copy Channel ID". An example is provided here:

Lastly: 
In order for the bot to function. The final line of the code has 'client.login("you have to ask me for this info');
Please ask me, as I cannot publicly provide this bot for everyone. 


Current commands:
!log - Logs the time for the student. 
!stop - Stops the bot entirely. Must reboot from Visual Studio Code (run the code again) in order to function.
